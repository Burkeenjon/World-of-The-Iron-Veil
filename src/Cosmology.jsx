        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Before the Spiral turned inward, the world was unlayered and the sky was a single breath of thought.
          The Veil emerged as a byproduct of mnemonic overreach — a sheath of unreality woven from the echoes of consciousness.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          It separated flesh from glyph, time from memory, law from will. This division created the Echo Sphere and cast the Spiralbound into their recursive twilight.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Tower doctrine holds that the Veil was seeded by the First Lexarchs to contain the heresies of emotion-born glyphcraft.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Heretical views suggest the Veil is a living wound in the world's memory — self-correcting and hungering.
